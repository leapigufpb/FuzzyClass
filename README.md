## A family of probabilities-based classifiers fuzzy and non-fuzzy

The classification predicament involves assigning labels or categories
to data instances based on observed features. Consider, for instance,
the task of discriminating between “spam” and “non-spam” emails. This
constitutes a classification task, where the algorithm must acquire the
ability to discern patterns that distinguish the two email types based
on their keywords, structure, or other attributes. Classification
algorithms employ a training dataset containing pre-labeled examples to
learn these patterns. When faced with unclassified data, the algorithm
applies the acquired patterns to predict the class to which they belong,
enabling efficient and precise automation in the categorization of new
cases. Algorithms like those in `FuzzyClass` address this task by
leveraging data probabilities and characteristics, thus becoming
valuable tools for addressing intricate and ambiguous classification
problems.

### Data Reading and Preparation\]

To demonstrate the usage of `FuzzyClass`, let’s look at reading and
preparing data:

``` r

library(FuzzyClass)

#' ---------------------------------------------
#' The following shows how the functions are used:
#' --------------
#' Reading a database:
#'
#' Actual training data:
data(VirtualRealityData)

VirtualRealityData <- as.data.frame(VirtualRealityData)

# Splitting into Training and Testing
split <- caTools::sample.split(t(VirtualRealityData[,1]), SplitRatio = 0.7)
Train <- subset(VirtualRealityData, split == "TRUE")
Test <- subset(VirtualRealityData, split == "FALSE")
# ----------------

test = Test[,-4]
```

#### Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes with Fuzzy Parameters

Let’s delve into the example of using the `Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes`
algorithm with fuzzy parameters:

``` r
# --------------------------------------------------
# Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes with Fuzzy Parameters


fit_FGNB <- GauNBFuzzyParam(train =  Train[,-4],
                                    cl = Train[,4], metd = 2, cores = 1)


print(fit_FGNB)
#> 
#> Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier for Discrete Predictors
#> 
#> Variables:
#> [1] "V1" "V2" "V3"
#> Class:
#> [1] "1" "2" "3"
saida <- predict(fit_FGNB, test)
Table <- table(factor(Test[,4]), saida)
Table
#>    saida
#>      1  2  3
#>   1 45  6  0
#>   2  7 51 14
#>   3  0 10 47

#Accuracy:
sum(diag(Table))/sum(Table)
#> [1] 0.7944444

saidaMatrix <- predict(fit_FGNB, test, type = "matrix")
```

Additionally, you can visualize the results:

``` r
# --------------------------------------------------
# head view

saida |> head()
#> [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1
#> Levels: 1 2 3

saidaMatrix |> head()
#>              1            2            3
#> [1,] 0.9992589 0.0007410196 8.975386e-08
#> [2,] 0.8379036 0.0985419165 6.355443e-02
#> [3,] 0.9952859 0.0047108312 3.226157e-06
#> [4,] 0.9917273 0.0082661561 6.539650e-06
#> [5,] 0.6723077 0.3112579462 1.643434e-02
#> [6,] 0.9828923 0.0170274151 8.028614e-05
```

This code appears to be related to the application of a classification
algorithm called “Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes with Fuzzy Parameters.” An
analysis of the steps present in the code:

1.  **Model Training** (`fit_FGNB`):
    - A Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes model is being fitted to the training
      data.
    - The training set consists of attributes (`Train[,-4]`) and classes
      (`Train[,4]`), where the categorical response variable or label is
      in column 4.
2.  **Prediction and Confusion Matrix Creation**:
    - The `predict` function is used to make predictions based on the
      fitted model using the test set (`test`).
    - A confusion matrix (`Table`) is created using the `table`
      function. The confusion matrix compares the actual (expected)
      classes with the classes predicted by the model.
3.  **Accuracy Calculation**:
    - The accuracy of the model is calculated by dividing the sum of the
      diagonal values of the confusion matrix (true positives and true
      negatives) by the total sum of the confusion matrix. This provides
      a measure of how well the model is performing predictions.

Overall, this code performs the training of a Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes
model with fuzzy parameters, makes predictions using the test set,
creates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model’s performance, and
calculates its accuracy.
