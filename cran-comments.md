This is a resubmission. In this version we have:

- Add the "Fuzzy Hipergeometric Naive Bayes classifier" as `FuzzyHipergeometricNaiveBayes`
- Add the "Double Weighted Fuzzy Hipergeometric Naive Bayes classifier" as `DWFuzzyHipergeometricNaiveBayes`
- Fix: memberships functions. Now they work correctly with dataframes
