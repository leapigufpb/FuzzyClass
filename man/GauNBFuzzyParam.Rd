\usage{
GauNBFuzzyParam(
  train,
  cl,
  alphacut = 1e-04,
  metd = 2,
  alp = c(0.35, 0.7, 0.86),
  w = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6),
  cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{matrix or data frame of training set cases.}

\item{cl}{factor of true classifications of training set}

\item{alphacut}{value of the alpha-cut parameter, this value is between 0 and 1.}

\item{metd}{Method of transforming the triangle into scalar, It is the type of data entry for the test sample, use metd 1 if you want to use the Yager technique, metd 2 if you want to use the Q technique of the uniformity test (article: Directional Statistics and Shape analysis), and metd 3 if you want to use the Thorani technique}

\item{alp}{When metd for 4, it is necessary to have alp which are alpha-cut defined}

\item{w}{When metd for 4, it is necessary to have w which are alpha-cut weights defined}

\item{cores}{how many cores of the computer do you want to use (default = 2)}
}
\value{
A vector of classifications
}
